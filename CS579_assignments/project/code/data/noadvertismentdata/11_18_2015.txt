rt AT_USER just like steve jobs of apple fame, a syrian immigrant became a billionaire in france. URL
people using steve jobs' name to help syrians, well, wouldn't you save them if jobs weren't a syrian migrant's kid?
read the books and you'll find that steve jobs was the son of a syrian migrant. not a refugee. there's a big difference.
steve jobs' father was the man who adopted and raised him. the magic syrian immigrant everyone is talking up was a louse, who abandoned him.
AT_USER AT_USER if it weren't for refugee sergey brin &amp; steve (son of syrian refugee) jobs we'd all still be using blackberrys
this "steve jobs was the son of a syrian immigrant" trope is tired‚Ä¶i think he stopped dining at his restaurant when he found out who he was
